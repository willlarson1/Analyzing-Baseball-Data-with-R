# Purpose
Since my interest in baseball analytics began around 2017, I have worked on multiple personal projects to explore publicly available data and draw my own conclusions about the sport. However, these projects have been unstructured and are now scattered in various locations, some of which I no longer have access to. This repository is the first step in a larger effort to compile a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my skills and passion for the field of baseball analytics.
